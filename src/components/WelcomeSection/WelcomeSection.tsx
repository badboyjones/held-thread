                    I'm Morrissey and I am the teacher and artist behind Held Thread Handwork.
                    <br /><br />
                    I built Held Thread on the belief that working with our hands nurtures both skill and soul. It is my goal to share these skills with whoever is called to them.
                    <br /><br />
                    Through slow, mindful making, we can develop patience, perseverance, and connection to one another and to our selves.
